# Setting up your machine
There are a number of components that are required to be installed to develop robotic code.

> Due to the restrictions with BSD laptops, you will need to have a personal laptop to program on.

1. Install VSCode + WPILib
This is the core development environment needed to write code. During install given the option to download VSCode or use an existing installation. Select download, as this will ensure we're all using the correct version of VSCode.

1. FRC Game Tools `non BSD network`
This installs additional tools for the game. These tools will also require that you get the license key. Please ask your lead for details.

1. Clone this years repo.
Get the code for this years project, which if you're reading this you should likely have it :)

1. Install recommended VSCode plugins `non BSD network`
Open the workspace file in VSCode. This is different to just opening the source folder. The workspace is configured with a few additional options which you won't get if you simply open the folder. The file should like similar to this:
`
frc2020.code-workspace
` 
After opening the `workspace` install the recommended workspace extensions, from the Extensions tab (Ctl-Shift-X).

> Due to restrictions within the BSD network (ie school network) some components can't be installed or configured correctly while connected to that network. You must therefore perform these tasks while connected to a different network (ie at home). These components marked with `non BSD network`.

Congratulations you're all setup and ready to code!
